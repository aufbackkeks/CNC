# The Protocol
This is the definition of the Protocol between
the PC and Arduino through Serial

## Packets
A packet is a stream of bytes send
in one pice and interpreted


| Type | Size | Payload |
|------|------|---------|

- Type (1B), the type of the packet
- Size (4B), the size of the Payload field
- Payload (SizeB), the payload of the packet

## Types
There are three types:
1. Requests
2. Commands
3. Checks

Each type is associated with one byte
pattern to send in the Type field.

### Checks

| Type | Size | Payload    |
|------|------|------------|
| 1    | 1    | check type |

The check type is another 1B figure
and each check has another check type
pattern.

### Commands
Fields:

| Type | Size | Payload      |
|------|------|--------------|
| 2    | 8    | motor ; time |

The Payload looks like this:

| motor | time |
|-------|------|
| uint  | uint |

The `motor` fields says which
motor should be power for
a specific `time`, a uint as well.

### Requests
There is, I think, only
one kind of this packet,
a request for new commands
by the Arduino to the PC.

| Type | Size | Payload            |
|------|------|--------------------|
| 3    | 1    | Number of Commands |

The Number of Commands is
the number of Commands that
the PC shall send to
the Arduino back.
